## STRATEGY:

Create an aesthetically pleasing, simple yet fast open source user interface content sharing app that is easy to navigate. The site allows users to create their profile (including avatar, username), and upload their own content including photos, titles and decriptions. Users can also view and interact with other users posts: liking, commenting. interact through our learn page.

The site will allow for user authentification, and basic CRUD functionality.

The goal is to create  code that is clear and allows you to update with ease.

## STRUCTURE:
HOMEPAGE - landing page, This is the page that initially loads when you first arrive at the site. Without logging-in
LOGO: link to home page.
NAVBAR: about,signIn,signUp.
ABOUT: Giving consumers the options and info before creating an account.
SIGNUI/SIGNUP: Ability to create a profile, excisting user ability to signIn.

LANDING PAGE: Once logged in....
Only difference is in the Navbar: App name, AddPost, learn, Feed, Liked, Sign Out, and Profile link and avatar.

ADDPOST - gives loggedIn users the ability to create a post and share an image it to be like and viewed by others.
LEARN - gives loggedIn users access to professional resourse, learning techniques.
FEED - ability to search post by title or content.
LIKED - shows the pics you have liked.

## Fonts and Color scheme
Exo & Ubuntu are the primary fonts I wanted to use because there soft and complamentarty. Giving of a sense of peace. the stroke in these font work well together.

Roboto
As a fall back I used Roboto and sans serif  as the standard. Good idea to have a fall back so your content is viewable.

In terms of the color scheme I went with something slightly different. Wanting to incorperate greens and blues as there assicated with seeking jobs, money, growth..
contrasting and vibrant colors on a white canvas.

### 
Had some major difficulties with this project, this is the third one ive made now and get a common problem across the board. CORS policy..(checked my code against the walkthrough and with tutor supposrt, checked Heroku and the urls etc. As you can tell the site is still incomplete thought i managed to slove the problem but keep running into errors relating to Dj-auth-user/registration/ etc  wasnt able to fully wrape my head around these areas.. Got help sometimes from tutor support managed to slove some errors but always came back short... restarted the project after some of the fontawsome icons wouldnt appear..  updated my kits etc.  As everything was working then suddenly didnt.. got as far as edit on one of the projects.

Some of the images - within the readme will show  how i wanted the site to look, function.
taking screengrabes from the other project created.

Im at a stage where im continuing on to trying and get a full operational site.

Current issues:
SignOut function not working - wont signOut a user.
When creating a post - press create, it doesnt seem to create (404 error).
PostPage - therefore doesnt display the post.. just the avatar default image.


CORS- resolve signIn and signUp - 
Main urls.py 
add to the back end replacing current..
ALLOWED_HOST = {*}
at the bottom on the page 
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True

FRONTEND - created a new variable linking to heroku 
constant file
"https://api-new1.herokuapp.com"

everytime a get or post method called i added (backend + '/posts/',

seemed to only resolve the signin and signup.
